Hi, I'm Lovepreet Singh. I am primarily a front-end developer with some experience in the back-end. I have created a few apps for Android in the past.

Websites should be simple for the UX to be great.

I love reading nonfiction about startups and biographies related to tech. I like Apple products, especially the MacBook Pro 2019 (even though I don't have one :P)

Mark Zuckerberg's early life as a student at Harvard when he created Facemash over a night motivates me.

Njoy!
